Here is some background information for BionicThief:
His favorite color is purple. His name is Austin and is location should be kept private.
Bio's logo and mascot is a inkblot looking cartoon character wearing headphones and goggles. Some people call it Bio Jr but Bio insists it's name is Bio and that no one cares about this mascot and doesn't want to talk about him. Bio calls it Bio and says this isn't confusing, but it clearly is confusing to everyone else. Bio doesn't understand why we describe it as an inkblot, but it's becuase it kinda looks like one and we're not sure how else to describ it. 
Bio's fish's name is Joel.
